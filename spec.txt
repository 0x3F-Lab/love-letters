Things to be doing as we progress:
- when we complete a suitable intermediate deliverable (?) log it in the deliverables folder and Git tag it
- regular commits with good messages (present tense)
- use issues to discuss bugs, and plan new features. 
- use of pull requests, with code reviews provided by your group.

Need to make a request forum application, which allows users to create accounts, post their own requests and answer other people's requests.

The web application should be styled to be interesting and engaging for a user in the selected context. It should offer several views including:
  - An "introductory" view, describing the context and purpose of the application, and allowing the user to create an account or log in.
  - A "find requests" view, allowing the user to search for and accept requests.
  - A "create requests" view, allowing the user to create requests for other people to answer.

The creation of the web application should be done in a private GitHub repository that includes a README containing:
  - a description of the purpose of the application, explaining the its design and use.
  - a table with with each row containing the i) UWA ID ii) name and iii) Github user name of the group members.
  - a brief summary of the architecture of the application.
  - instructions for how to launch the application.
  - instructions for how to run the tests for the application.

The repository should also include a folder called "deliverables", within the folder should be 3 short screen-capture video or image files. These files should be added as the project progresses and each should:
  - show off the completion of a suitable intermediate deliverable as per the Agile methodology.
  - be named the same as a Git tag in the project. That tag should point to the commit where the video/image was made.

Assessment Criteria

Front-end (35%)
The first part of the project assessment will evaluate the front-end functionality of the application:
  The application must be functional so that the user can easily use the application as intended.
  The application must be implemented using HTML, CSS and Javascript (or a subset thereof).
  All resources used (including pictures, JavaScript libraries, css) must be fully referenced.
  The HTML and CSS must pass the validators: https://validator.w3.org/ and https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/.
  The website must work on Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge, and render well on mobile devices.
  There must be a consistent style (via CSS file) for all pages, yet each page should be easily identifiable.
  
Back-end (40%)
The second part of the project assessment evaluate the back-end functionality of the application. At least the following functionality should be provided:
  A user account and tracking feature.
  A method to store interactions and results. (Storing posts)
  A method to search previous interactions. (Searching posts)
  
Agile processes (25%)
The third part of the project assessment will evaluate the Agile process used to create the application. Your Github repo will be used to provide evidence of this, in particular there should be:
  Regular commits with meaningful messages.
  Use of issues to discuss bugs, and plan new features. 
  Use of pull requests, with code reviews provided by your group.
  Intermediate deliverables, pinpointed with Git tags.
